FSB Sprint 1
x  Register
x    create fsb account
x      rough html home page - Done.  ugly but done.
x      link to reg - openID - skip for now, come back later
x      link to "save and connect to FS" - verify it can do initial call
x        record token in user prefs record
x        verify that logout/login retains fs account, can call api
x        verify logout disconnects from api?
    import fs data
      checkins
        use batch based flow already in mapper
          in the for each, parse out venues for below
        need venue history - each user gets a record indicating each unique venue they've been to. 3 tables - user, u-v, venue(?).
          this drives accessibility of battle locations.  like teleporting to your history.
        record last update? if the user uses both FS and FSB, FS could have checkins that havent yet been added to FSB.  
        no reward for these - dont want to headstart people past the fast and fun part of the treadmill
      badges
        just record them for now - badge table, and u-b table?
        later, give some sort of non-functional benefit to these?  styled clothes, teleportation, auto-sale of junk
      friends - match w/ fsb friends
        if my fs friends also have fsb, present them in a list, with the option to request their friendship
        later include the ability to request your fs friends join fsb - "X wants to battle you.  They said - 'Rarrrrgh'" 
        this same flow happens in the iphone app as well.
    character creation
      initialize stats
      view stats
    api-ify the app engine app so it can respond to iphone app
      add an api controller that responds with xml to valid urls like /api/checkin, /api/battle, /api/friend
      
Other stuff - 
  refactor file structure so its less scroll-y

FSB Sprint 2 tentative
  gameify
    basic battle - attack a place, drain health, stamina, etc, on minions, then turn based boss battle
    loot and exp reward
